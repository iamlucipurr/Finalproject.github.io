<h2 class="title">Stoobz</h2>

<img src="laneartist.jpg" alt=" Stoobz artist picture " class="imagefix">

<p class="para">Lane better known as Stoobz has always had a passion for music.
 At an early age he started on piano,
  moved to guitar eventually moving to producing because he could make backing tracks to jam to,
 later on in high school he discovered electronic music and the rest is history.
 His main goal behind all of it to inspire others,
  like so many other artists have done for him through the emotional and spiritually connected music he plays.
 Lane believes that with enough inspiration anyone can do anything,
  even see things through new eyes and look at the beautiful world in a new way. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
<p class="para"> Lane has stated that without his inspirational hero’s like BT, 
Porter Robinson, GRiZ, ally and fila, john o’callagan, above and beyond, seven lions, 
deadmau5, Spor, and Feed me he might not be the artist he is today. 
Inspiration being one of the biggest motivators in his music career to drive him towards the giving back 
to his listeners just like his inspirational heroes have for him 
</p>
<p class="para">Keep your eye out for Stoobz there’s honestly no real telling what he’s going to do next whether he’s opening for Kyau & albert or K theory (which he’s totally done!) 
or just jamming at a house party or warehouse gig his events have and always will be worth going to!

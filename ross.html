<p class="para"> Ross is not only a talented pianist, but also has the voice of an angel. we hear at SLC Night.Lyfe had the chance to get an artist bio from Ross himself!

<p class="para"> 	

	Born in The Country of south Africa, I first discovered my musical talent when singing amongst my first grade fellows,<br />
 during a rendition on Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, the entire gymnasium went quite as they all listened to me finish the song alone.
 From then on I have always felt separated from most of the human race musically. When one’s voice alone can stop a room full of people, 
not because of what’s being said, but because of the sound alone… it changes you. <br />

<p class="para"> 
I used to think I wanted to be rich and famous one day, 
but after discovering that the professional music industry is a bastardization of the beauty of music in and of itself I have changed my mind,
 and now I wish to perform for the soul purpose of my music being heard, 
understood and appreciated, whether that be by allowing my fans to escape their lives for just a moment, 
or allowing them to feel as though someone does actually understand them. <br /> 



</p>
<p class="para"> 
	I do vocals for various types of Electronic Music 
(think, the male version on Elle Golding) 
I do covers of popular songs on guitar and piano, 
and I create acoustic covers of various songs throughout my life that have significant meaning to me personally.
 If you are to ever catch me around a piano or guitar in a public place or private, I am sure to give you your own private concert.
